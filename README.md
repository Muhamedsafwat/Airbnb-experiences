# Airbnb-experiences
another simple project for practicing Reactjs !
I just used a simple javaScript object to get data from, in order to practice some concepts like : mapping through arrays, passing props and conditional rendering

didn't give big attention to the styling , was just focusing on what i'm recently learning

of course you can preview from the link below ðŸ‘‡
